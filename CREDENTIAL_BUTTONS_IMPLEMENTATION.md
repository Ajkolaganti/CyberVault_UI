# Credential Vault Button Functionality Implementation

## Overview

Implemented full functionality for the View, Copy, Edit, and Delete buttons in the Credential Vault component.

## Features Added

### 1. **View Credential**
- Opens a detailed modal showing all credential information
- Displays: Name, Type, Username, Environment, Status, Last Accessed, Created date
- Includes a "Copy Password" button in the modal
- Modal can be closed via "Close" button or clicking outside

### 2. **Copy Credential**
- Copies the credential password/value to clipboard
- Uses modern `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` API
- Shows success/error alerts for user feedback
- Works both from the card buttons and the view modal

### 3. **Edit Credential**
- Currently shows a placeholder alert
- Can be extended to open an edit modal in the future
- Button is properly connected to handler function

### 4. **Delete Credential**
- Shows confirmation dialog before deletion
- Makes DELETE API call to `/api/v1/credentials/:id`
- Removes credential from local state on success
- Shows loading state on the delete button during API call
- Prevents multiple simultaneous delete operations
- Shows success/error feedback

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
const [viewingCredential, setViewingCredential] = useState<Credential | null>(null);
const [actionLoading, setActionLoading] = useState<string | null>(null);
```

### Handler Functions
- `handleViewCredential(credential)` - Opens view modal
- `handleCopyCredential(credential)` - Copies password to clipboard
- `handleEditCredential(credential)` - Placeholder for edit functionality
- `handleDeleteCredential(credential)` - Deletes credential with confirmation

### Button Integration
All buttons now have proper `onClick` handlers:
```typescript
<Button onClick={() => handleViewCredential(credential)}>View</Button>
<Button onClick={() => handleCopyCredential(credential)}>Copy</Button>
<Button onClick={() => handleEditCredential(credential)}>Edit</Button>
<Button onClick={() => handleDeleteCredential(credential)} loading={actionLoading === credential.id}>Delete</Button>
```

### View Modal
- Full-featured modal using the existing Modal component
- Displays all credential fields in a clean layout
- Read-only fields with proper formatting
- Copy button integrated within the modal

## API Endpoints Used

- **DELETE /api/v1/credentials/:id** - Delete credential

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Visual Feedback**: Loading states on buttons during operations
2. **Confirmation**: Delete confirmation dialog to prevent accidents
3. **Error Handling**: Proper error messages for failed operations
4. **Accessibility**: Proper button states and modal focus management
5. **Responsive Design**: Modal works well on all screen sizes

## Security Considerations

- Password values are only copied to clipboard, never displayed on screen
- Delete operations require explicit user confirmation
- All API calls include proper authentication headers
- Sensitive data is handled securely in the view modal

## Testing the Features

1. **View Button**: Click to see credential details in modal
2. **Copy Button**: Click to copy password, check clipboard
3. **Edit Button**: Click to see placeholder (ready for future implementation)
4. **Delete Button**: Click to delete with confirmation dialog
5. **Empty State**: "Add Credential" button now works properly

## Future Enhancements

- Replace alerts with toast notifications for better UX
- Implement edit credential functionality with proper modal
- Add bulk operations (select multiple credentials)
- Add password strength indicators
- Add credential expiration tracking
- Add audit log for credential access

## Files Modified

- `/src/pages/CredentialVault.tsx` - Added all button functionality and view modal
